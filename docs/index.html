                This project is meant to show how the cancer rate in Central Appalachia is tied to the presence of Mountaintop removal mining sites. This is shown through a county-level choropleth map of the cancer rate, with a polygon layer on top of that which shows the physical extent of mountain-top removal sites. While these two factors are shown in the main map, there are two smaller maps to show further data. The second map shows the presence of cancerous pollutants in the air. This is shown by a continuous layer that shows relative presence of pollutants, with a layer showing the outline of Central Appalachian counties. The last map highlights the poverty rate in Central Appalachia with yet another choropleth at the county-level

                Texas is a coastal state that has been hit by tropical storms throughout history. With the inclusion of storms from the past twenty years, the population of Texas counties, and the income per capita of Texas counties, this map reviews how population and income has changed as storm activity has increased.

                This web map focuses on exposing Ohio Students to the emerging jobs of the future in renewable energy. This map will be used as part of my graduate assistantship project where we create and present renewable energy lesson plans for Ohio high school students. The purpose of the lesson plans is to incorporate renewable energy for high school students to enhance education and expose students in Ohio to the emerging fields of the future. This web map will help us locate public schools in poverty areas that may not have funding or opportunities to bring guest speakers to talk about renewable energy and career connections. These opportunities should be available for all high school students. The web map also includes the location of renewable energy power plants, renewable energy businesses (contractors, installers, manufactures, etc.) and universities that offer bachelors degree majors related to renewable energy. Universities and jobs are included in this web map since the future and goals of every student are different. Some may want to earn a college degree while others want to work in a job that does not require a degree. Both of these jobs can be found in renewable energy power plants and industries. Showing the left side map by itself to students can help them search for jobs or universities that align with their goals. 
                Renewable energy resources and considerable opportunities of energy efficiency exist at many regions in the United States. Other than reducing carbon emissions, deployment of renewable energy and scientific diversification of energy sources could substantially bring safety and economical benefits. The economical benefits can be succeeded with lowering electric utility bills and most importantly creating new jobs. Ohio is a well known state for its history in coal production. Although, First Solar Inc. is the largest manufacter of PV solar panels in the U.S. and it is located in Perrysburg, Ohio. Therefore, there is a big chance that more jobs will be created in the renewable energy industry in the state of Ohio.

                Many Residents in the Appalachian region do not have access to healthy food. There are many variables that can come into play. One variable that limits the access to healthy food is the lack of stores that supply these healthy foods. Another variable that limits residents of the Appalachian region to having access to healthy food is the affordance of these foods. Many residents are a part of governmental assistance programs such as SNAP benefits. SNAP Benefit participants are selected based on annual income, either by person or by household. Within my web map I have created a map showing these variables, such as where SNAP participants can shop, what type of stores they can shop at and I will also be showing the areas that do not have a store for these residents to shop at. The layer that features no stores is the area called a food desert. I am also showing population density and will be showing the amount of people below the poverty line. Appalachian residents face many healthy disparities such as obesity rates and malnutrition, which can all be linked to poor dieting and not having an access to healthy foods. My map overall will allow the user to see where the food deserts are and compare the amount of stores in that area, what type of stores, and how populated the area or county is around the stores, or food deserts.
